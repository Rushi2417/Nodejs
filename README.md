# Learning Node.js Basics

Welcome to my Node.js learning repository! Here, I've documented my journey through learning the basics of Node.js, including essential concepts like REPL, Native Node modules, and NPM.

## Introduction to Node.js

Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to build scalable, server-side applications using JavaScript.

## Concepts Covered

### 1. REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)

Node.js comes with a built-in REPL environment that allows you to interactively run JavaScript code. It stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop.

### 2. Native Node Modules

Node.js provides a set of built-in modules that you can use in your applications without installing any additional packages. These modules include `fs` (File System), `http`, `os` (Operating System), and more.

### 3. NPM (Node Package Manager)

NPM is the default package manager for Node.js and JavaScript. It allows you to install, manage, and share packages/modules with other developers. You can also use it to manage project dependencies.

## Getting Started

To get started with Node.js development, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Set up a new Node.js project using `npm init`.
3. Explore the core concepts of Node.js, including REPL, Native Modules, and NPM.
4. Dive into building simple applications and gradually expand your knowledge.
